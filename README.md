# Road Toward AI for Autonomous Driving ðŸš—ðŸ¤–

This repository captures my step-by-step journey into **Deep Learning for Autonomous Driving**.  
Starting from toy datasets, I gradually built up my skills in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)  
and applied them to real-world perception tasks like **traffic sign recognition**.

## ðŸ“˜ Step 1 â€“ Fashion-MNIST: Learning the Basics
Notebook: [`Fashion_CNN.ipynb`](./Fashion_CNN.ipynb)

- First hands-on CNN implementation.  
- Learned about **convolutions, pooling, and fully connected layers**.  
- Classified clothing items in the **Fashion-MNIST** dataset.  
- Gained intuition about how CNNs extract features from raw pixels.

ðŸ‘‰ *This stage gave me the foundation to apply CNNs beyond simple examples.*

## ðŸ“— Step 2 â€“ Number Recognition (MNIST)
Notebook: [`Number_recognition_CNN.ipynb`](./Number_recognition_CNN.ipynb)

- Extended CNN knowledge to **digit classification** with the classic **MNIST dataset**.  
- Focused on:
  - Training deeper networks.
  - Handling larger training data efficiently.
  - Improving accuracy with better hyperparameters.  
- Digits connect directly to **autonomous driving use-cases** (e.g., speed limits, road numbers).

ðŸ‘‰ *Here I started connecting CNN skills with perception tasks needed in self-driving.*

## ðŸ“• Step 3 â€“ Traffic Sign Recognition (GTSRB)
Notebook: [`Traffic_sign_CNN.ipynb`](./Traffic_sign_CNN.ipynb)

- Final milestone: **German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB)**.  
- Built a CNN capable of classifying road signs â€” a **core ADAS task**.  
- Introduced:
  - **Feature maps** for visualizing learned filters.  
  - **Grad-CAM** for model interpretability (seeing *where* the CNN looks).  

ðŸ‘‰ *This stage directly ties deep learning to **autonomous driving perception systems.***

## ðŸŒ± Reflection â€“ From Pixels to Roads
- Began with toy datasets to learn **how CNNs work**.  
- Progressed to **digits**, connecting to driving-relevant numbers.  
- Reached **traffic signs**, aligning with **real-world autonomous driving needs**.  

This progression shows not just technical learning, but also a **clear roadmap toward AI in self-driving vehicles**.
